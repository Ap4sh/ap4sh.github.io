Hey :)

I'm a 19 yo cyber enthusiast currently student & pentester in France.
I'm passionate about many areas of IT especially Active Directory and web hacking, but I consider myself a jack of all trades, master of none, always eager to learn and explore new domains.
I also love doing CTF's, development, and i'm also doing some bug hunting.
